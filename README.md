# üç∞ Cakedesigner API

Back-end API for the CakeDesigner virtual store, built with **Spring Boot** and integrated with a **React** front-end. The API provides secure user authentication, role-based access control, product image storage, and integration with an external API to retrieve address data for delivery.

## Features

- Full CRUD for product types and products
- CORS configuration (currently allowing `localhost:3000`)
- Image storage in a local directory, with the full image path stored in a **PostgreSQL** database via **JPA**
- JWT authentication with role-based access control (**ADMIN**, **USER**)
- External ZIP code (CEP) API integration to retrieve delivery address data

## üîí Security Notes

- The following paths are **public**:

  - `GET /manage/product`
  - All `/auth/**` routes
  - Static files under `/uploads/images/**`

- All other routes are **protected** and require JWT authentication.

- Product routes for `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` require a valid **admin token**.

- Uploaded product images are saved in a local `uploads/images/` directory, and their complete URL path is stored in the database:
